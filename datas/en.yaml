description: |
  I am Alexandre Marre, a computer enthusiast since childhood. I started learning C at home when I was sixteen years old. Quickly, I developed a real love for this field and chose to deepen my knowledge at school. This led me to a preparatory class and the 42 school. \
  I am a fervent supporter of open source and strive to contribute and help projects on Github or other platforms whenever possible. I am curious and love to learn and discover new things, which makes me a Jack-of-all-trades. I am used to working with agile methods and respect the KISS and YAGNI principles.
